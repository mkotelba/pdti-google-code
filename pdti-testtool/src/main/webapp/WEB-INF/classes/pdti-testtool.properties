purpose.header=Purpose of this Tool
purpose.language=The Healthcare Provider Directory Plus Test Tool was created to test conformance to the specifications produced by the Modular Specifications Provider Directory (MSPD) project. Additionally, the web service definition provided by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) specifications is supported. The test tool is based on the written test package and requirement traceability matrix created by the MSPD project under the direction of the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC).
future.plans.header=Future Plans
future.plans.language=The tool fulfills Meaningful Use Stage 2 (MU2) and will be rolled into NIST's overall testing toolkit over time. Feedback from community usage will be prioritized as received, and the tool will have additional releases scheduled as needed.

Please select the type of WSDL that you wish to test. The MSPD effort supports two WSDL types:\
<ul>\
<li>The <em>IHE WSDL</em> is the published version of the IHE Provider Directories WSDL directly from their specifications. See <a id="problemlink" href="http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_HPD_Rev1-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf">http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_HPD_Rev1-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf</a>, or for the actual WSDL see HPD_ProviderInformationDirectory.wsdl at <a href="ftp://ftp.ihe.net/TF_Implementation_Material/ITI/wsdl">ftp://ftp.ihe.net/TF_Implementation_Material/ITI/wsdl</a>.</li>\
<li>The <em>MSPD WSDL</em> was developed to add functionality over the IHE WSDL, notably improved error handling and federation support. See <a href="http://modularspecs.siframework.org/Provider+Directories+Artifacts">http://modularspecs.siframework.org/Provider+Directories+Artifacts</a>.</li>\
</ul>\
</p>
wsdl.url.dialog.html=<p>Please provide the URL on your Provider Directories server at which the WSDL can be reached.</p>
basedn.dialog.html=<p>Please provide the base DN of your data source. This is at the level above Providers, Organizations, <i>etc.</i> For example, the test data provided in the MSPD code base has a base DN of "o=dev.provider-directories.com,dc=hpd".</p>
